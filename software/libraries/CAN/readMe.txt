// This Arduino version library was developed based on Fabian Greif's  
// "universelle-can-bibliothek",
// see: http://www.kreatives-chaos.com/artikel/universelle-can-bibliothek
// and: https://github.com/dergraaf/avr-can-lib
// This work is published under a BSD license.

// The adaptation to Arduino was done by Kevin Bruget.
// Cyrill Guillemot and Xi Chen added functions 
// to allow separate fetching of CAN id and data part of a packet.

To use it just copy/paste this directory into Arduino library folder.

For some comments on differences to the original library, see
file "CAN.h".
