chipShooter
===========

"chipShooter" is a little python script showing
where to put components during PCB hand assembly. 
Furthermore, giving it data about component stacks, 
it can display component rotation and generate machine control files 
for a pick and place machine.

Give it a try with the accompanying example data by typing "./chipshooter.py".

Usage for your own PCBs:
- create board data following the stuff in directory exampleBoardData :
You will need an image showing the PCB, board.size file, component placement data and BOM.
I get the data exporting it from PCB design software (gEDA), cutting images to board.size, 
and editing the BOM manually to add line number and my personal component 'stock_id's.
When associating 'stock_id's to component stacks, and giving information about the
stacks (reels etc.,  see file componentStacks.csv), this data will be displayed too.
Use an empty componentStacks.csv file if you do not need this feature.

- start ./chipShooter
Now you can advance, component by component, using up and down arrows as well 
as page up and down. For each component, the cross-hair shows the place where to place it.
Mouse wheel, as well as '+' and '-' keys, zoom the image. Mouse middle button allows to pan.

If componentStacks.csv is available, chipshooter shows rotation on the crosshair and can 
generate machine control files for the TM240A pick and place machine.


Future work (I would like that to be done.):
- make a  better user interface
- make it possible to edit data in the interface (changing reels, rotation angles etc)
- data base integration:
  having component stock, BOM etc. in a database would help generating more automatically 
  all the files needed : pricing of BOMs through the web, lists of components to order, assisted 
  association of components in schematic to stock_ids etc.
