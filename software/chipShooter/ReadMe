chipShooter
===========

"chipShooter" is a little python program showing
where to put components during PCB hand assembly. 
Furthermore, giving it data about component stacks, 
it can display component rotation and generate machine control files 
for a pick and place machine.

Take a look at the screenshots and give it a try using the accompanying 
example data by typing "./chipshooter.py".

Usage for your own PCBs
-----------------------
- create board data following the files in directory exampleBoardData :
You will need an image showing the PCB, board.size file, component placement data (.xy) and BOM.
I get the data exporting it from PCB design software (gEDA), cutting images to board.size, 
and editing the BOM manually to add line numbers and my personal component 'stock_id's.
When associating 'stock_id's to component stacks, and giving information about the
stacks (see file componentStacks.csv), this data will be displayed too.
Use an empty componentStacks.csv file if you do not need this feature.

- launch the program: ./chipShooter
Now you can advance, component by component, using up and down arrows as well 
as page up and down. For each component, the cross-hair shows the place where to place it.
Mouse wheel, as well as '+' and '-' keys, zoom the image. Mouse middle button allows to pan.

If componentStacks.csv is available, chipshooter shows rotation on the crosshair (for verification) 
and can generate machine control files for the TM240A pick and place machine.


Future work (I would like that to be done.)
-------------------------------------------
- make a  better user interface
- allow for importing/exporting from/to other software and machines
- make it possible to edit data in the interface 
  (changing component stack association, rotation angle etc)
- database integration:
  having component stock, BOM etc. in a database would help generating more automatically 
  all the files needed : pricing of BOMs through the web, lists of components to order, assisted 
  association of components in schematic to 'stock_id's etc.
